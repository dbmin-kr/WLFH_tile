The synthesis of a Wigner light field hologram with tiling calculation involves dividing the computational domain into smaller tiles to manage the high computational demands of generating such holograms.
This method allows for the efficient computation of high-resolution holograms by processing smaller sections independently and then combining them. Tiling helps to optimize memory usage and parallel processing, enabling the synthesis of complex holographic scenes at higher resolutions.
This approach is particularly useful when dealing with large datasets or when aiming to produce holograms with detailed spatial and angular information, as is the case with Wigner light field holograms.
